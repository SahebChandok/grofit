I have used xaamp server for maintaining the database.
Move all the files in xaamp -> htdocs
You need to create a database 'userdb' in xaamp.
'userdb' has two coloumns 'name' and 'password'.
I have attached a json file with name 'usertable.sql', you need to import it in the xaamp server.
You can type 'localhost/grofits/' in your browser's search bar to visit the website.
